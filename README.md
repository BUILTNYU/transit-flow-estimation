This project contains two tools for transit flow estimation; one for schedule-based flow, one for static flow.
The orgnization and structure of these two tools are similar; they have two modes: assginent mode and estimation mode.
Welcome to point out the issues in these code. Welcome to use these code for research purpose, and please cite:
